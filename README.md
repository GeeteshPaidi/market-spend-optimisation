## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Missing Channel Data**: Ensure all channels exist in marketing data file
- **Column Name Variations**: Check for consistency between 'Content_Marketing' and 'Content Marketing'

- **Negative Values**: Check rebalancing procedure in disaggregation
- **Memory Errors**: Process data in chunks or reduce time period

### Performance Optimization
- Use smaller data samples for initial testing
- Adjust XGBoost parameters for faster training
- Simplify constraints in optimization models
- Run modules independently for specific analyses
